# chat-example

This is the source code a chat server that is based on the a very simple chat example used for the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.

I have added features such as rooms, usernames, password protection, unqiue names for users and rooms etc.
